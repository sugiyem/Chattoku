# Introducing Chattoku

with each other, as well as providing them with various anime-related features. <br />

# Motivation
As an anime lovers, it is not rare for us, members of team W, to encounter a situation
where we don’t know what other anime to watch or with whom we should discuss the
anime that is currently trending. Now, the most used app to fulfill that goal is
MyAnimeList and Reddit. However, the MyAnimeList mobile app doesn’t support its
forum (It redirects the user to its website when trying to open a discussion) and
Reddit is not specialized for the otaku (anime appreciator) community. Hence, we
would like to create a new app, which we named Chattoku (Chat + Otaku), to
overcome this inconvenience.
# Aim
We aim to create a cross-platform mobile application for anime lovers that will
provide them with anime databases, and a recommendation system based on their
favorite genre and anime series, as well as a platform to discuss various topics with
other users via forum and direct messages.
